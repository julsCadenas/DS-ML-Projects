# Investigation Netflix Movies
- A short activity from the *[Associate Data Scientist Course](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/career-tracks/associate-data-scientist-in-python)* from DataCamp. Where the user is tasked to apply the foundational Python skills they learned in the *Introduction to Python* and *Intermediate Python* courses by manipulating and visualizing movie data.

### Activity Instructions:
1. Filter the data for movies released in the 1990s.
- You'll want to subset the DataFrame to keep only the movies and then filter the years so that you are working with rows where the release year is between 1990 and 1999.

2. Find the most frequent movie duration
- Visualize the data to view the distributions of durations for movies released in the 1990s.

3. Count the number of short action movies from the 1990s.
- First, subset the data again to keep only movies with the correct genre. Then, iterate through the data and count the number of movies depending on the condition of a duration that is less than 90.
